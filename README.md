ShootStress is a novel software that enables high-throughput analyses of A. thaliana's movement, which can be valuable for furthering the understanding of plant health. ShootStress is based on the Lucas-Kanade algorithm and uses consecutive segmented images of plants to track the plant's movement and quantify its magnitude over time.
